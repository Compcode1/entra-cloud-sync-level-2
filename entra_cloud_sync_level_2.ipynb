    "# Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync Project: Level 2\n",
    "# Title: CloudSync Deployment â€“ Level 2: Technical Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "PROJECT CONTEXT\n",
    "This notebook builds on the previously completed Level 1 facsimile project for Acme Finance Group,\n",
    "which established the business case for initiating Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync from a traditional\n",
    "on-premises Active Directory. In this Level 2 project, we simulate the technical steps required to\n",
    "configure Cloud Sync in a small-to-medium business scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario Recap:\n",
    "- Company: Acme Finance Group (Regional Accounting Firm)\n",
    "- Goal: Enable secure sign-in to Microsoft 365 for on-premises AD users via Microsoft Entra ID\n",
    "- Chosen Path: Lightweight Cloud Sync due to small IT staff and no need for advanced transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on key setup stages, agent deployment, scope configuration, and validation.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. INSTALL CLOUD SYNC AGENT\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Action: Download and install Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync Agent on a domain-joined Windows Server.\n",
    "- Purpose: Bridge between on-prem AD and Microsoft Entra ID.\n",
    "- Requirements:\n",
    "  - .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later\n",
    "  - Outbound access to Microsoft Entra URLs and ports (TCP 443)\n",
    "  - Local admin rights on target server\n",
    "- Sample Facsimile Output:\n",
    "  Simulated: 'Agent registered successfully with Microsoft Entra ID tenant xyz.onmicrosoft.com'\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. GRANT DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Action: Use delegated admin permissions or provide cloud provisioning app access to on-prem AD.\n",
    "- Facsimile Step:\n",
    "  - Simulated domain: acme.local\n",
    "  - Admin grants permissions using provided wizard\n",
    "  - Verification screen: 'Domain acme.local successfully authorized'\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. CONFIGURE SYNC SCOPE\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Action: Define which organizational units (OUs), users, or groups are synchronized.\n",
    "- Reason: Avoid syncing service accounts, test users, or outdated entities\n",
    "- Facsimile Example:\n",
    "  - Include: OU=Finance,DC=acme,DC=local\n",
    "  - Exclude: OU=TestAccounts,DC=acme,DC=local\n",
    "  - Tool: Microsoft Entra Admin Center > Identity > Cloud Sync > Configuration Wizard\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. MAP ATTRIBUTES (DEFAULT MAPPING)\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Action: Use built-in attribute mappings unless business logic requires otherwise.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - AD attribute: userPrincipalName -> Entra ID UPN\n",
    "  - AD attribute: mail -> Entra ID email address\n",
    "- Comment: Attribute transformations are limited in Cloud Sync but can be edited in UI\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. VALIDATE SYNC AND IDENTITY STATE\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Action: Review successful sync status in Microsoft Entra admin center\n",
    "- Output Signals:\n",
    "  - Sync cycle timestamp (e.g., 08:15 AM UTC, status: success)\n",
    "  - User object 'John.Doe@acme.com' now visible in Microsoft Entra ID > Users\n",
    "  - Matching sourceAnchor confirms linkage to on-prem AD object\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKPOINTS (Early Signals)\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Failure cases:\n",
    "  - Agent status offline\n",
    "  - Duplicate attribute errors (e.g., UPN already in use)\n",
    "  - Connectivity issues to Entra ID endpoints\n",
    "- Observation:\n",
    "  - Admin Center will show warnings and sync failures in dashboard view\n",
    "- Mitigation:\n",
    "  - Restart agent service\n",
    "  - Adjust sync scope to avoid conflicts\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. PROJECT WRAP-UP (LEVEL 2)\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Outcome: Initial technical setup completed and validated\n",
    "- Outcome Artifacts:\n",
    "  - Agent installed and linked\n",
    "  - Sync configuration (OUs filtered)\n",
    "  - Attributes mapped, default rules applied\n",
    "  - Successful object sync visible in portal\n",
    "- Foundation built for: Level 3 (custom rules and business logic refinement)\n",
    "\"\"\"\n"
